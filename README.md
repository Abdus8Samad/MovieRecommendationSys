# Movie Recommendation System

The proliferation of data collection has ushered in a new era of information, prompting the emergence of Recommendation Systems. These systems play a crucial role in information filtering, enhancing search result quality, and providing users with more relevant items based on their search queries and browsing history.

Recommendation Systems employ algorithms to forecast user ratings or preferences for specific items. Nearly every prominent technology company has implemented such systems in various capacities. For instance, Amazon employs them to suggest products to customers, YouTube relies on them to determine the next video to play in autoplay, and Facebook employs them to offer page recommendations and suggest people to follow. Additionally, companies like Netflix and Spotify heavily rely on the efficacy of their recommendation engines for business growth and success.

## Introduction

The movie recommendation system is built to assist users in discovering new movies based on their preferences and the preferences of other users with similar tastes. By analyzing historical data, the system learns patterns and makes predictions to suggest movies that users are likely to enjoy. This README provides an overview of the system, its installation instructions, and details about the underlying algorithms and evaluation metrics.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can use the movie recommendation system by following these steps:

1. Search the Movie Title/Name.
   
3. System will recommend you top 10 movies related to your search.

## Data

The movie recommendation system relies on a dataset of movies and user preferences. The dataset contains information such as movie titles, genres, release dates, and user ratings. The data is used for training the recommendation system and used Machine Learning Techniques for evaluation.

Dataset Used:
- [TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)
- [The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset)

## Basis of System

The movie recommendation system employs various machine learning techniques to generate accurate recommendations. Some of the algorithms used include:

- Demographic Filtering: Demographic filtering is a method of information filtering that considers demographic attributes, such as age, gender, location, or income, to tailor content or recommendations to specific user groups.

- Content-Based Filtering: This approach recommends movies based on their content features, such as genres, actors, directors, and plot summaries. It finds similarities between movies to suggest items with similar attributes.

## Algorithms

- Demographic Filtering

## Future Improvements

The movie recommendation system can be enhanced in several ways:

- Incorporating deep learning techniques, such as neural networks, to capture more intricate patterns and improve recommendation accuracy.

- Implementing a hybrid recommendation approach that combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering for more robust and diverse recommendations.

- Enhancing the user interface and user experience to make the system more intuitive and user-friendly.

- Integrating external data sources, such as user reviews and social media data, to gather more information and improve the recommendation quality.

- Adding more search queries like Genre, Director Name & Actors name (currently works only on movies name).
